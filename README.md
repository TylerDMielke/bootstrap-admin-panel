# bootstrap-admin-panel
Admin panel for server administration using bootstrap and various node modules. This panel, once installed on a server, should
  allow the administration of that sever with the use of powershell scripts that are currently a work in progress.

Main html file exists in the html directory and is simply named index.html. Just open that file to view the project at the
  current state of completion.
  
This project is still a work in progress.
